# PayfortSample2020
This is a Payfort Sample built using the instruction in the Payfort Doc 2020. 

This sample is not production ready, and should only be used for overview of Mobile SDK channel work-funtionality.

This project is not more than a sample, and only been created as a working sample. Please do your own set of customization and optimizations. 

You are free to Fork and use it as you like. 
I will accept any good PR which can improve the project( like deprecation or improvment in some Methods) , but not overcomplicate it with Optimizations.
